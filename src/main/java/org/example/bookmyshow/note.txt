1) Don't make repository classes directly instead make repository interfaces this will allow us to change the type of DB in
   future(inMemory, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB etc.) without breaking our services as for all these interfaces we'd be having
   implementations based on the type of DB we want to use.
2) In this codebase we've used in memory DB(simply created hashmaps for tables/indexes).

3) Since typically for a Show based on the SeatType, price is calculated. So we can save up some space by storing price for every SeatType
   in ShowSeatType instead of storing price for every seat in ShowSeat.

4) #1st task - createBooking
    BookingController, BookingService, BookingRepository
